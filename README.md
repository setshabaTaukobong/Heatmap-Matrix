# Heatmap-Matrix
A heatmap matrix script that generates a restructured dataframe from a variant calling output file for conditional formatting in Excel. This script is intended for use as a post-processing step after trimming, filtering and variant calling. To ensure reproducibility of results, we have provided a variant calling output file (Dataset-Amino-Acid-Mutations.csv) and a metadata file (SARS_COV_2_analysis_2.xlsx). We hav also included the output matrix file (.xlsx), in this repository.
